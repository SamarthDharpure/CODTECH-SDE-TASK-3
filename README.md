### Internship Task - 3
**Company:** CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS  
**Intern:** Samarth Dharpure

**Domain:** Software Development  
**Duration:** 4 Weeks  
**Mentor:** Neela Santhosh Kumar

## 📌 Overview of the Project

**Project:** REAL-TIME COLLABORATION TOOL  
This project is a real-time collaborative editor that allows multiple users to write and edit notes or code simultaneously — similar to Google Docs. It uses WebSocket via Socket.IO to enable bi-directional communication between clients and ensures instant sync of updates across all users connected to the same document.

This was developed as part of the internship with CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS to demonstrate real-time data sharing, WebSocket handling, and a functional full-stack app using React and Node.js.

## 💡 Features

- **Live Editing**: Collaborate on text in real-time across multiple devices.
- **Multi-User Support**: Seamless collaboration with WebSocket sync.
- **Simple UI**: Clean and distraction-free interface.
- **Auto-Broadcasting**: One user types, all others see the update instantly.
- **No Login Needed**: Instant collaboration via shared access.
- **Modular Structure**: Separated frontend (React) and backend (Node.js) projects.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript (ES6+), Socket.IO Client
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO Server, CORS
- **Styling**: CSS (basic styling or Tailwind support)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Frontend), Render/Railway (Backend)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run the project locally, install:

- Node.js and npm
